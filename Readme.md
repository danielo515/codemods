# Danielo codemods
This is a collection of [ codemods ](https://github.com/facebook/codemod) designed to blend any javascript codebase to my tyrannical desires.
Codemods here will re-factor pieces of javascript code to adhere to certain programming practices that I think are better than others.
Please check the documentation for each codemod to understand what it is supposed to do.
